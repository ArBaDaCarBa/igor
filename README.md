# **IGoR: Inference and Generation Of Repertoires** #

# README #


This repository contains all sources and models useful to infer V(D)J recombination related processes for TCR or BCR sequencing data using **IGoR**

### Quick summary ###

IGoR is a C++ software designed to infer V(D)J recombination related processes from sequencing data such as:
* Recombination model probability distribution
* Hypermutation model
* Best candidates recombination scenarios
* Generation probabilities of sequences (even hypermutated)

Its heavily object oriented and modular style was designed to ensure long term support and evolvability for new tasks in assessing TCR and BCR receptors features.
